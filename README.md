## Buying Options

Some notes on buying the book.

I personally bought the book from Google Play because the price there was lower than in many other places. An issue with buying from Google Play is that there are videos that complement the book that are not included in the Google Plap edition. So what I did was to register the book at informit.com and then from there it was possible to download a file with all the videos.

Otherwise the book is also available in paper version from most book stores.

You can also get an coures from (learncodthehardway.org)[https://learncodethehardway.org/] and then the videos and other content will be available for you there, I assume.
